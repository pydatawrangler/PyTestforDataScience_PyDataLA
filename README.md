# Pytest for Data Science
Pytest for Data Science Beginners. No prior testing knowledge is assumed!  
This is a tutorial given at PyData Los Angeles 2018

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydatawrangler/PyTestforDataScience_PyDataLA/master)

## Goal
Introduce testing philosophy and code. By end of tutorial attendees will be able to write pytest unit tests themselves. Specifically they will know about

* Pytest test patterns
* Pytest Fixures
* Mock
* Monkeypatch
* References to advanced topics such as parameterized tests and test runner configuration

# Agenda
## Introduction
About the speaker and format of talk

## Is testing needed in Data Science?
Spoiler alert, yes. Testing is widely used in serious data science. We'll cover examples and real world cases.

## Instructor Examples and Attendee activities
This tutorial will have plenty of hands on activities. Each section below will have an instructor explanation followed with a student challenge.

## How pytest works and writing a basic test
We'll cover how to structure tests for use with pytest, and also an example of why pytest is the preferred testing framework for many projects

## Test Fixtures
Fixtures are an important component of testing that allows for reuse of mutable data structures. If this doesn't make sense now it will after going through this example.

## Mock
Loading data or running a model sometimes takes minutes or even hours. We'll see how mock can be used to "fake" python data structures to make writing and running tests faster and more isolated.

## Monkey Patch
In data science you'll frequently be using other peoples libraries. This example will show how to alter functionality during testing time and why this is sometimes desired.

## Next steps and advanced topics
We'll have an open discussion about functionality such as parametrization, test finalizers, exception testing, and code coverage
